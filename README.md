  ##  Analysis overview:
  ###  Temperature vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot:
  **Discussion about the linear relationship:** As you get closer to the Equator line the Temperatures increase, showed by a negative relationship between Max Temp and Latitude in the North Hemisphere and a positive relationship between Max Temp and Latitute in the South Hemisphere.

  ### Humidity vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
  **Discussion about the linear relationship:** In the North Hemisphere the is a soft positive correlation between latitude and humidity, but it is not possible to define a linear relationship between humidity and latitude in the South Hemisphere.

  ### Cloudiness vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
  **Discussion about the linear relationship:** Cloudiness does not correlate with latitude regarding any hemisphere.

  ### Wind Speed vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
  **Discussion about the linear relationship:** Wind speed does not fluctuate much on the latitudes evaluated for the north hemisphere and there is more of a variation in the south hemisphere with a tendency of slower wind speed closer to the Equator line.

####Observations
- My hvplot.pandas package was not working properly and even with support of teachers and learning Support I was not able to fix it, and as I got to the end of my assignment, I was not able to print plots to add to this ReadMe.
